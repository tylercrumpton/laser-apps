# Crump's Laser Apps

This is a collection of tools I've written to help me with my laser cutting projects. They may or may not be useful to you, but I'm making them available in case they are! (And so that I can host them on GitHub ðŸ˜‰)

## tokens.html

This app generates an SVG with a series of double sided tokens with words on either side. It's original use was for making tokens for a class of students with the student's name on one side, and word describing them on the other.

It uses different color strokes for the various parts of the token so that you can easily change the laser settings of the tokens in the laser cutter software.
